📂 **GitHub Repositories**
Explore my work:

**Repository 1 iNotebook:** iNotebook is a feature-rich project where users can seamlessly add, delete, and update notes. This application was developed using React, and I integrated core React hooks such as useState, useEect, and useContext to manage state, lifecycle events, and context eciently.
For the backend, I utilized Node.js to build RESTful APIs, enabling secure and ecient communication between the frontend and the MongoDB database. User authentication was implemented as a security measure, ensuring that only logged-in users could create, modify, or delete notes..
